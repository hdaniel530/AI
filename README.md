# Artificial Intelligence Projects

## Project #1:
Given an initial and goal state of a n x n board of numbers, utilizes A* search algorithm with Manhattan distances to find solution (outputs moves and number of moves need to reach goal state from initial state). If no solution, "No solution found" is outputted.

### Instructions to run:
- Python 3 and above is needed to run the code

- Place the input file in the same directory as the code so you could simply write the filename in the next step otherwise you would need to write the path\filename in the next step

- In the main function, change the first parameter of open() to be the input filename.txt in string quotes

- Then execute the code by running python; prints output to console/shell and to a file called output.txt


## Project #2:
MNIST digit classification/recognition using back propagation and sigmoid activation, outputting a confusion matrix and MSE (mean squared error) within training intervals to show accuracy

### Instructions to run:
- Python 3 and above is needed to run the code as well as numpy library

- Place the training and test files in the same directory as the code so you could simply write the filename in the next step otherwise you would need to write the path\filename in the next step

- In the main function, change the first parameter of open() to be the filename in string quotes(for the open() functions with second parameter as “rb” place .raw file(images) and as “r” place .txt file(labels))
	- Match training images with training labels and test images with test labels

- Then execute the code by running python; prints output to console/shell

- **Able to change learning rate and number of hidden layers (learning rate of 0.1 was used)
